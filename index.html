      <p>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).<p>

<p>IT has become such a diverse industry over the past 2 decades, that it is hard to ignore how vital it is, not only to tech-based companies, but for the day to day operation of all large and small scale organizations across the world. This is the idea that sparked my interest in IT. Although I may not be majoring my studying in the IT world, I believe a fundamental knowledge of how the industry operates to better prepare me for the ever-changing world of modern corporate operations.<p> 

<p>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?<p>

<p>I chose RMIT for its ease and convenience of online classes. Working full time within the finance industry, RMIT has allowed me to focus not only on my day job, but also allow me to study in my own time, with the flexibility of location and quality of education. <p>

<p>What do you expect to learn during your studies?<p>

<p>I expect to gain a further understanding of how IT is engrained into modern day society, and expand my knowledge base to better prepare myself for future roles in my given field.<p>

      <h1><b>The Job</b></h1>
      <p>IT Portfolio Financial Analyst <p>
        <p> My client is currently seeking an IT Portfolio Financial Analyst to assist in the completion of a range of financial reporting for multiple programs and projects. Your primary focus will be to develop financial reporting with a secondary focus to ensure the accuracy of reporting, highlighting discrepancies as they arise..</p>
      <p> What job? <p>

<p> With my experience within the finance sector, I find it very interesting with the growing use of different technological advances, allowing for new levels of understanding of the financial changes in markets and portfolios. This role would give me a better understanding of a completely different way to analyze the data that is given from financial performance, including pricing, risk and trends. <p>

<p> Why me? 

<p> With my current educational skills in finance, my desire to operate within a team, and my new educational pathway in IT, this job would allow me to implement these skills in an area that I would not only find interesting, but could help stakeholders in increasing their financial wealth. To be successful in getting this job, I would need to finish a degree in the IT field and have the skills and knowledge to be able to implement the skills I currently have in finance on the desired platforms.<p>

      <h1><b>My Project </b></h1>
      <p>Project Idea: <p>
<p>A system which allows individuals to input in their generalized financial details in relation to a specific area they need assistance with; whether it be their superannuation, or their debt, and provide a general financial plan for them to achieve these goals. This could be inputted by an application, either online via website, or on a smart phone, and allow not only for peace of mind with financial decisions, but also to allow for the individual to improve their financial literacy in a user friendly experience. The app/website would also include educational information around areas which are found to be areas of high use, for example, mortgages. <p>

<p>Motivation: <p>
<p>With the Australian financial industry being put under lots of scrutiny over the past decade, including the Royal Commission investigation and the GFC of 2007, people are very hesitant and untrusting of many financial services. This project idea would eliminate the use of a seemingly ‘broken’ and untrustworthy system, and allow for individuals to make their own educated decisions with their finances. From a marketable perspective, this would give the consumer of the product a format to skip the middle man (i.e., Financial Advisor or Banker), and to produce successful results with their financial goals. <p>

<p>Description: <p>
<p>My application/website will be broken down into 3 specific areas which Australian’s often have issues with financially. A membership educational service will be set up that will give the client access to the three topics with information and potentially articles and blogs from financially literate individuals. It will also allow for the personalized general advice system in each area, where personal details are injected into the system, and a modelling based output would give clients better understanding of how their ideas would realistically impact them. <p>

<p>Areas of interest: <p>

<p>SUPERANNUATION<p>
<p>The super industry in Australia was set up over two decades ago and has now grown to be the largest pool of retirement funds in the world. Although this industry is so large, it is also regarded as the least accessed industry in Australia; i.e., people know their employer is paying super, but have no idea where the funds are invested or how they are invested. My project would increase the awareness of the necessity of one client’s superannuation by outlining how the funds allow for healthy and comfortable retirement, that does not rely solely on the age pension. The application will provide graphs based on statistical trends in the markets, which would show the client how their funds would both grow over time, and feed a pension to them once their income stops. <p>

<p>DEBT: <p>
<p>It is very common for individuals to fall into debt holes at very young ages with money being so easily accessible through credit cards, personal loans and mortgages. What people often overlook, is how their lifestyle will be effected once they must start servicing these debts. My application would allow clients to input their current expenditure of essentials, and lifestyle spending, and model what a reasonable amount of debt would be to minimize the opportunity cost of debt. The saying ‘there is no such thing as healthy debt,’ is not exactly true. Debt allows for people to make the purchases they need to make, whether it be a family home or a holiday, and pay it back at affordable weekly, monthly or yearly rates. The cost of this debt is what people often overlook, but with the educational knowledge derived from my application, individuals would have a stronger understanding of what a reasonable amount of debt would be, and through projectional graphs show how long it would take to reasonably pay off the debt.<p> 

<p>Savings: <p>
<p>Personal savings is an area that people often struggle to make headwind with as it is much easier to spend money than earn it. A savings tool in the app would show clients where they would be after a predetermined time frame with savings in either a bank, managed fund, or individual investments. This will also be displayed on projectional models to give clients an easy to read understanding of how their savings plan would play out. This section would also include educational information on different investment options that arise through market trends or new areas of interest that open to the public. <p>

<p>TOOLS: <p>
Initially the project would need a stable platform developed that would allow for the introduction of modelling software for a variety of different outcomes. The platform would start with a website based design that would eventually move to an application base, once the initial testing of the platform has been released to the public. Modelling software could be developed internally or purchased through existing providers. Generalized advice documents would be developed from the system in which we would need to have a platform that can adapt to the different inputs of each client. <p>

<p>Skills: <p>
<p>Initially basic HTML skills would be needed to develop the online based website design. This would need to be expanded to App development areas for the integration of the website and application to be seamless. We would need to have the skills to build the modelling, and can change it to align with the multitude of regulatory reform that occurs within the industry. <p>

<p>Outcome: <p>
<p>If this project is successful, members would have access to a multitude of tools and educational streams which would allow for successful implementation of their financial goals. Although similar systems exist, no system currently provides generalized advice documents, which would expand the existing advice industry to new areas. Being the leading technological developer in this area, we would be the key provider of the advice and create greater financial literacy and comfort for all households in Australia.
