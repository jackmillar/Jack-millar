      <p>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).<p>

<p>IT has become such a diverse industry over the past 2 decades, that it is hard to ignore how vital it is, not only to tech-based companies, but for the day to day operation of all large and small scale organizations across the world. This is the idea that sparked my interest in IT. Although I may not be majoring my studying in the IT world, I believe a fundamental knowledge of how the industry operates to better prepare me for the ever-changing world of modern corporate operations.<p> 

<p>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?<p>

<p>I chose RMIT for its ease and convenience of online classes. Working full time within the finance industry, RMIT has allowed me to focus not only on my day job, but also allow me to study in my own time, with the flexibility of location and quality of education. <p>

<p>What do you expect to learn during your studies?<p>

<p>I expect to gain a further understanding of how IT is engrained into modern day society, and expand my knowledge base to better prepare myself for future roles in my given field.<p>
